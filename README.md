#  MASTERMIND

This is an implementation of code-breaking game Mastermind with the "Cows and Bulls" variant.  Instead of colored pegs, the objective is to guess a 4-digit number, and there's more vague feedback about which letters are both correct and in the right position, and which letters are correct and in the wrong position, which makes it more challenging.

The assignment was to also include AI, which has not yet been implemented, so this is v0.9.
